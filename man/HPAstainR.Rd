\arguments{
\item{gene_list}{A list of proteins or genes that you want to query the HPA
staining data with.}

\item{hpa_dat}{The data frame of normal HPA staining data data, required to
run HPAStainR.}

\item{cancer_dat}{The data frame of pathologic HPA staining data, required
to run HPAStainr.}

\item{cancer_analysis}{A character string indicating inclusion of cancer data
in the result, must be one of "normal" (default), "cancer", or "both".}

\item{tissue_level}{A boolean that determines whether tissue level data for
the cell types are included. Default is TRUE}

\item{stringency}{A character string indicating how stringent the confidence
level of the staining findings have to be. Must be "normal" (default),
"high", or "low".}

\item{scale_abundance}{A boolean that determines whether you scale Staining
Score based on the size of the gene list. Default is TRUE.}

\item{round_to}{A numeric that determines how many decimals in numeric
outputs are desired. Default 2.}

\item{csv_names}{A Boolean determining if you want names suited for a csv
file/pipeline, or for presentation. Default is TRUE giving csv names.}

\item{stained_gene_data}{A boolean determining if there is a list of which
proteins stained, TRUE is default.}

\item{tested_protein_column}{A boolean determining if there is a column
listing which proteins were tested, TRUE is default.}

\item{percent_or_count}{A character string determining if percent of proteins
stained, count of proteins stained, or both are shown for high, medium, and
low staining. Must be "percent" (default), "count", or "both".}

\item{drop_na_row}{A boolean that determines if cell types with no proteins
tested are kept or dropped, default is FALSE.}

\item{adjusted_pvals}{A boolean indicating if you want the p-values corrected
for multiple testing. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the results of HPAStainR.

\description{
Uses a protein/gene list to query Human Protein Atlas (HPA)
 staining data.

\section{Details}{

Calculation of the staining score below:
\deqn{(\frac{h \times 100}{t}) + (\frac{m \times 50}{t}) +
 (\frac{l \times 25}{t})}

\examples{
## Below will give you the results found on the shiny app website
## This example also uses HPA_data_downloader output as an example
HPA_data <- HPA_data_downloader(tissue_type = "both", save_file = FALSE)
HPA_out <- HPAStainR(c("PRSS1", "PNLIP", "CELA3A", "PRL"),
 HPA_data$hpa_dat,
 HPA_data$cancer_dat,
 "both")
