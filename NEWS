Changes in Version 1.0.3 (2021-02-03)
    + Changed read.table() in HPA_data_downloader.R to data.table's fread()
Changes in Version 1.0.4 (2021-2-17)
    + The first update in response to F1000 comments
    + Added dating arguments to HPA_data_downloader
        + Now when you have save_file set to true, the file will be stamped with
        the date it was downloaded. This allows for reproducible access to the
        file you created.
        + To deal with dated files we now have the arguments
        `version_date_normal` and `version_date_cancer`, which allows users to
        select which downloaded HPA data they want to use based on the date of
        downloading. The default to "last" which will search for the latest
        version of the files in the `save_location`
        + The last addition is `force_download`, an argument that will overide
        the function's default usage of the local files in case you want to 
        download a more recent version of the HPA data.
    + Change to HPAStainR and by extension shiny_HPAStainR
        + Added Fisher's Exact Test to HPAStainR's main function
            + Due to the inconsistency that exists in using simulated p-values in 
            `chisq.test` the default new test if Fisher's exact and an argument 
            `test_type` has been added so users can pick between the two. 
        + Changed the output of the p-values to numeric instead of a character.
